# Allwinner D1 Nezha Board Development Environment

![Board](./doc/nezha.webp)

This repository gives you access to an easy to setup chroot
environment that allows compilation of and experimentation with the
system software of the Linux-capable 64-bit RISC-V
[Nezha](https://liliputing.com/2021/05/nezha-is-a-99-single-board-pc-with-a-risc-v-processor.html)
board:

- [OpenSBI](https://github.com/riscv/opensbi),
- [U-Boot](https://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot), and
- [Linux](https://www.kernel.org/)

with out the hassle of setting up a RISC-V cross-compilation
environment and keeping it working.

## Relevant Documentation

The
[linux-sunxi](https://linux-sunxi.org/Allwinner_Nezha#Manual_build)
wiki contains detailed instruction on how to find and build OpenSBI,
U-Boot, and Linux for the Nezha board. This description largely
applies.

**Note:** You have to use `CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-`
instead of `CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu-`. But the chroot already
comes with this automatically set in the environment.

## Usage

To use the chroot in this repository, you need to [install
Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html).

Then you can enter the [Nix
shell](https://ghedam.at/15978/an-introduction-to-nix-shell).

```sh
$ nix-shell
```

You can streamline entering the Nix shell by using
[direnv](https://direnv.net/), which makes this automatic when you
`cd` into the directory.

If you enter this shell the first time, it will be slow, because the
cross-compilation toolchain is built. Going forward, this toolchain is
cached. My [Cachix](https://www.cachix.org/) repo may contain prebuilt
copies built in this repo via Github Actions. You can do `cachix use
blitz` to use it.

After entering the Nix shell, you have access to three tools:

- `fhs`, which drops you into the Nezha development chroot,
- `connect-nezha`, which connects to the serial port of the Nezha
  board (if you [connected a USB serial
  adapter](https://linux-sunxi.org/Allwinner_Nezha#Adding_a_serial_port)
  to the debug pins),
- [niv](https://github.com/nmattia/niv), which is used to update this
  environment.

After you enter the chroot, you can compile system software for the
Nezha board following the linux-sunxi wiki:

```sh

nix-shell $ fhs

fhs-chrootenv $ cd work
fhs-chrootenv work $ git clone https://github.com/smaeul/opensbi -b d1-wip
...

# The environment variable is already set for you convenience.
fhs-chrootenv work $ echo CROSS_COMPILE
riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-

fhs-chrootenv work $ PLATFORM=generic FW_PIC=y make -C opensbi
...
 AS        platform/generic/firmware/fw_payload.o
 ELF       platform/generic/firmware/fw_payload.elf
 OBJCOPY   platform/generic/firmware/fw_payload.bin
```

ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ That's it. Happy cross compiling! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
